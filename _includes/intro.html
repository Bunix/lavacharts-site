<p class="lead">Lavacharts is a wrapper for Google's powerful Javascript Chart API</p>
<ul class="arrows">
  <li>The Lavachart library takes away the need for manual writing of Javascript in your views</li>
  <li>The library wraps the work of generating the proper Javascript, so you can focus on the data and not the JS in page.</li>
  <li>Configuration is intuitive and easy to follow since it correlates 1:1 with the Google Chart API.</li>
  <li>Designed to work with any PHP project, but some bonus features were added for Laravel users.</li>
  <li>Laravel specific features include: A ServiceProvider, Facade, and Blade template extensions.</li>
